<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a young-adult and just started to work my first job! My sister and I grew up mostly in the Free State, South Africa, but we also moved around a lot. I fell in love with reading books and I like to expand my knowledge. In the near future, I want to write short stories and publish it on Wattpad.</p>

<p>I have four amazing friends who are very supportive. We laugh a lot and they are the ones that encouraged me in this field of work in Web Development. I am very grateful for them and my family for pushing me to achieve many things in life.</p>

<p>I am very creative. I love acting, singing, recently dancing and would in most cases throw a mini-concert for my family. I finsihed high school and I want to do Au Pair oversees. I love children and have the patience of a trutle. Children brings the biggest joy in the household and let your inner-child come out again! </p>
